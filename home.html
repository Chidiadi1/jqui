                <ul class="experience-ul">
                    <li>Design static responsive (mobile & web) websites with HTML5, CSS, flexbox. Deploying websites via a cloud-based content delivery network distribution (cloud front) using the s3 bucket API endpoint as the origin. Used DNS service (Route 53) to assign a custom domain name for access to the website thus providing a lower latency, higher security and cost optimized solution.</li>
                    <li>Set up a simple RESTful API serverless microservice solution with user authentication, this relieved the pressure on the business logic team and increased work-delivery time productivity by 35%.</li>
                    <li>Implement conversion and testing of application to a Decoupled Architecture solution for an event-based application using a queuing service to ensure application run and fail independently which significantly reduces time taken for application bug detection and debugging.</li>
                    <li>Generate Infrastructure as code JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Templates for tested and approved applications to enable rapid and scalable on-demand deployment in the cloud.</li>
                    <li>Create custom Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) from scratch for hosting solution applications. Ensure necessary networking resources such as internet gateway, private subnet for business logic database, public subnet for web tier resources set up route tables, security groups and NACLs were configured for optimal network security and cost performance.</li>
                    <li>Established a central management platform for Test, Development and Production environments (accounts) for easy monitoring and necessary control of access to relevant resources. Allocated separate billing for each environment in compliance with standard requirements.</li>
                    <li>Monitor deployed resources for Cost optimization and Security with AWS Trusted Advisor and AWS cost explorer. Use AWS budgets and AWS Billing to forecast and control expenditure respectively. Maximize free-tier offerings as a part of Cost management which has led to a 20% reduction in Organization accounts (test, dev & prod) overall cloud expenses the last 6 months.</li>
